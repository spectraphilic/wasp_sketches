- Lora SX1272, SPI bus, Socket 0
- No security, no OTA
- Work always with antennas attached
- Distance 3-4 meters between modules
- Network defined by channel and mode

Configuration (Lora):
- Power level: L H M (hardcoded in config.h)
- Channel, e.g. CH_10_868 865.20 Mhz (hardcoded in config.h)
- Mode is configurable (var lora_mode), local tests with mode 10, find out
  which one is best in the field (page 16)

To test:
- Ping
- RSSI (Received Signal Strength) and SNR (Signal-to-Noise  Ratio) page 24
- If address=1 (gateway) will not send through Lora (so will send with 4G only)
- FIFO/LIFO Upgrade process

TODO:
- Too much program memory with 4G specially
- Handle incoming frames: print, save, send
- Send frames at different times to avoid collisions
- Support in rssimap.pde sketch
- Rename WITH_ to USE_
- Set time from Lora network?
- Multi-hop (star) topology
