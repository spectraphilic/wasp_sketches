- Lora SX1272, SPI bus, Socket 0
- No security, no OTA
- Work always with antennas attached
- Distance 3-4 meters between modules
- Network defined by channel and mode

Configuration (Lora):
- Power level: L H M (hardcoded in config.h)
- Channel, e.g. CH_10_868 865.20 Mhz (hardcoded in config.h)
- Mode is configurable (var lora_mode), local tests with mode 10, find out
  which one is best in the field (page 16)

Tested:
- Ping with RSSI and SNR
- The rssimap.pde sketch

To test:
* Multi-hop: with dst=0 reset if several attempts fail

TODO:
- Use packnum in ACK for verification purposes
- Test test: timing, time command, etc.
- Verify TODO/XXX/FIXME
- Reduce memory further (specially with 4G)

MAYBE:
- rssimap: Add SNR frame field?

Issues:
- With the eeprom changes, at first log level becomes FATAL and log to USB is
  disabled, so you don't see anything and it looks broken.
