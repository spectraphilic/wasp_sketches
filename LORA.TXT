- Lora SX1272, SPI bus, Socket 0
- No security, no OTA
- Work always with antennas attached
- Distance 3-4 meters between modules
- Network defined by channel and mode

Configuration (Lora):
- Power level: L H M (hardcoded in config.h)
- Channel, e.g. CH_10_868 865.20 Mhz (hardcoded in config.h)
- Mode is configurable (var lora_mode), local tests with mode 10, find out
  which one is best in the field (page 16)

Tested:
- Ping with RSSI and SNR
- The rssimap.pde sketch

TODO:
- Gateway: keep lora module receiving even if doing something else?
- Test test
- Verify TODO/XXX/FIXME
- Send through the Gateway, Lora/4G combo
- Test no regressions with XBee
- More tests of FIFO/LIFO upgrade
- Reduce memory further (specially with 4G)

MAYBE:
- rssimap: Add SNR frame field?
- Multi-hop (star) topology

Issues:
- With the eeprom changes, at first log level becomes FATAL and log to USB is
  disabled, so you don't see anything and it looks broken.
