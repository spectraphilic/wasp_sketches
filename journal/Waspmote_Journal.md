## Drift lower lidar (6718414.19, 419401.31) 

### 2017-11-19

- waspmote ID 6D4467057C1054DC 
- uploaded script Finse_3 commit  [ceb90f9](https://github.com/spectraphilic/wasp_sketches/commit/ceb90f985209c339bfe596dd1aee61f71033df72) on . 
- UTC time, SD, GPS, lithium Bat, solar panel, Libelium box. 
- Sensors: DS-2. Sampling interval: 3m. Moved on the same pole as the drift lower lidar, right next to the radar.

Deployement of a waspmote v15 with the following config:

- waspmote ID: 01f566f057c105487
- DS 2 sensor, 5min sampling
- Script commit [ceb90f9](https://github.com/spectraphilic/wasp_sketches/commit/ceb90f985209c339bfe596dd1aee61f71033df72)

### 2017-12-14

This staion stopped nov 24. 
 - Battery voltage: 12.4
 - Station was totaly covered in ice
 - Waspmote box full of snow, my theory is that the lid was installed 90 deg of
 - Copied log-file and data from SD
 - Connecting with serial monitor gave no thing
 - Tried to upload a new program but that didn't work
 - Changed to a new waspmote
 - Changed to a longer antenna (8 dbi)
 - Broke the GPS antenna when i changed waspmote, so now there are no GPS installed
 - I have tried the unit i changed, and now when it's dry it works fine
 - ...but with the GPS it keeps bugging for me. Might be that the GPS is more sensitive to humidity???
 - I have nice pictures showing riming on the wind sensor.

## Middalselvi (6716590.57, 417951.37)

### 2017-11-20

Collect of the data from SD card. battery at 94%. Sven try pushing new script with no success. needs maintenance. Waspmote v12 with Libelium box and solar panel. Lithium battery. CTD-10 sensor.

### 2017-11-20

Swithced the v12 waspmote for a v15 (serial ID: 3F7C67057C105419)
