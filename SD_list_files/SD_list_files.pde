/*  
 *  ------ [SD_06] - List files inside the SD card -------- 
 *  
 *  Explanation: Turn on the SD card. Firstly, delete all folder and
 *  all contained files. Secondly, create all directories specified in
 *  path. Finally, create files inside each subfolder and show the created 
 *  directories and files. 
 *  The rest of the program shows how to list the directories in several ways.
